**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Purpose

**Goal:** Clearly and concisely describe the primary objective of this task. What is the high-level goal you want the agent to achieve?

* **Example:** "The purpose of this task is to create a responsive login screen for a mobile application. This screen will handle user authentication and provide feedback in case of errors."

-   [ ] **Secondary Actions:**
    -   [ ] A "Forgot Password?" link.
    -   [ ] A "Sign up for a new account" link.

## 3. Key Files

**Description:** List all the relevant files the agent will need to interact with, create, or modify. This helps the agent to focus on the correct parts of the codebase.

* **To Be Created:**
    * `src/screens/LoginScreen.js`
    * `src/components/auth/LoginForm.js`
    * `src/styles/LoginScreenStyles.css`

* **To Be Modified:**
    * `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js` (to add the new screen)
    * `src/services/AuthService.js` (to use the login function)

* **To Be Referenced:**
    * `src/theme/colors.js`
    * `src/components/common/CustomButton.js`
    * `src/assets/icons/logo.svg`

---

## 4. Business Flow

**Description:** Describe the user interaction flow from start to finish. This helps the agent understand the sequence of events and the expected outcomes. Use a step-by-step format.

1.  **User arrives on the Login Screen.**
    * **System displays:** The UI with the email field, password field, "Login" button (initially disabled), "Forgot Password?" link, and "Sign Up" link.
2.  **User enters a valid email and password.**
    * **System response:** The "Login" button becomes enabled.
3.  **User clicks the "Login" button.**
    * **System action:**
        * The button displays a loading spinner.
        * The application calls the `login(email, password)` function from `AuthService.js`.
    * **Success Outcome:**
        * The user is redirected to the "Dashboard" screen.
    * **Failure Outcome:**
        * A general error message "Invalid email or password" is displayed.
        * The loading spinner on the button is hidden.
4.  **User clicks the "Forgot Password?" link.**
    * **System action:** Navigate the user to the `ForgotPasswordScreen`.

## 5. Aware (Prerequisites & Context)

**Description:** List the foundational and pre-existing modules, configurations, or conventions the agent must be aware of and utilize. This ensures consistency with the rest of your project.

* **Fonts:**
    * Please use the primary font defined in `src/theme/typography.js`. The main font is 'Inter'.

* **Localization:**
    * All user-facing strings (e.g., "Login", "Email", "Password") must be retrieved from our localization file: `src/localization/en.json`. Do not hardcode text.
    * Use the `t()` translation function from our i18n utility.

* **Error Handling:**
    * All API call errors should be caught and processed through the global `ErrorHandler.js` service.

* **Dependency Injection (DI):**
    * Services like `AuthService` should be injected where needed, not instantiated directly. Follow the existing DI pattern in the project.

* **State Management:**
    * Use the existing state management solution (e.g., Redux, MobX, Context API) to manage the user's authentication state.

* **Styling:**
    * Adhere to the existing styling conventions. Use CSS Modules / Styled Components as found in other parts of the application.
